## Prompt the user for a number either on a form input or the terminal. Depending on whether the number is even or odd, display  either “odd” or “even” to the user.
## Hint: how does an even / odd number react differently when divided by 2?


##BDD
 # user input integer eg(3)
 # programe will output true

 ##pseudo code
  # def a fun to find  if num is even or odd
  # declare var(x) to  store and accept input
  # use if condition to check whether x is divisible by 2 without a reminder and store  it,the result in var y
  # return y

def num():
    x =int(input["num"])
